# ObjectSpawner

This class will help you spawn random meshes along a spline. Once you place down an instance of the class, it will come with a Spline component, which can be deformed into any shape and objects will be spawned along this Spline. To control the spawning parameters, refer to the `MinInstances`, `MaxInstances`, `MinOffset`, `MaxOffset`, `ConsiderObjectDimensions`, `KeepLooping` and `IntervalTime`.

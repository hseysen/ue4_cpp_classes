# Unreal Engine 4 C++ Classes

All of these classes are made by me through my journey as a developer. I'll be updating this repo along the way to store useful classes in case I need to refer to them later at some point.

## How to use these classes?

Create a new C++ class in Unreal Engine, with the same name as the class indicated in the repo. Note that your `.h` file will contain something like:

```class PROJECT_API```

Where `PROJECT` will correspond to your project name. Remember this API name, copy and paste the `.h` and `.cpp` files' contents to your files, and rewrite the correct `_API` to the class declaration. Everything should work without errors when you compile the project.
